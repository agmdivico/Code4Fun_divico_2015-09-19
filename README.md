Exercises

A. Write a program to fill an array of size N with the numbers from 1 to N in random order without duplicates
Refrain from using shuffling algorithms or framework provided methods

B. Without using framework provided methods such as Count, Getlem or similar, write a program to return the Nth element from the end of a generic type singly linked list, in one pass.
The program will take 2 parameters:
- the index N from the end of the list
- the generic singly linked list
For example, given N = 5 and the list of integers {82, 55, 78, 92, 12, 44, 51}, the program should return 78.
You should implement the singly linked list also.


C. Write a program to efficiently find the frequency of any given word in a book.
